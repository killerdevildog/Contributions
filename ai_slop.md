## Detailed Comments

### 1. OpenTTD/OpenTTD [#14518](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pull/14518)

> "You did not fill in the PR template properly. Please follow the template and don't just paste AI-generated text in there, write it yourself."

---

### 2. Dav1dde/glad [#518](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad/pull/518)

> "This looks like unreviewed AI garbage, I appreciate the thought of wanting to contribute, but you should realize that this wastes somebody elses time. While I do not mind having unexperienced **people** contribute and help them get on the right track, I have 0 desire to waste my time talking to a toaster."

> "If you read the code you realize it does absolutely nothing except add noise."

### 3. mlpack/mlpack [#3979](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/3979)

**@rcurtin (Project Owner):**
> "Please don't generate PRs with LLMs. This is not the right approach at all to resolving the issue."

**@niansa:**
> "For starters, LLMs never really have a full picture of the codebase. That leads to issues being solved in very unclear or non optimal ways."
>
> "Here it looks like your LLM has attempted to solve this issue by apparently doing thread synchronization of some sort? This might solve a symptom of the issue that leads to the crash but the actual underlaying issue remains unsolved."
>
> "**TLDR**: Don't use LLMs for actual open source projects, thank you."
>
> "What prompt did you use to have Claude (or ...) write that reply for you? No human writes text containing `<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>`."
>
> "Let's not feed the trolls. Ran a bit of a background check, judging by the fact that he is counting commits and pull requests in his resume, and the frequency at which he's opening pull requests on GitHub it looks like simply trying to make his counters go up in his resume. Very possible that it's even some kind of bot that's writing the comments here?"

### 4. pypa/pip [#13518](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13518)

**@ichard26:**
> "It's clear that these PRs and the comments have written with the assistance of LLM tools. This in itself is not problematic, but we still expect that you are able to understand, review, and correct the output of said LLM tools to better fit the project expectations and needs."
>
> "As you may know (or not!), LLMs are prone to hallucinations .. or in other words, lying/making things up."
>
> "My larger point is that it can be challenging to engage in a discussion where LLMs are used heavily. Imagine if you were talking to someone who was lying or missing the point constantly. You'd feel frustrated and like there isn't a point to engage further. I'm not saying that you are lying. The LLM is doing the lying. BUT, you are responsible for your contributions, PRs and comments included."
>
> "I'm sorry, it's not worthwhile for maintainers to be responding to walls of text generated via an LLM that's consistently being wrong."

### 5. pypa/pip [#13489](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13489)

**@timmc:**
> "FYI, this author is a heavy LLM user and does not vet the LLM output; they've been opening a lot of PRs that are then getting rejected for being slop. You'll need to review their work very carefully."

---

### 6. Razakhel/RaZ [#68](https://github.com/Razakhel/RaZ/pull/68)

> "Don't waste your time, this user is just posting a whole bunch of AI slop on GitHub to up the PR counter in his resume."

---

### 7. mikke89/RmlUi [#797](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/797)

> "Don't waste your time, this user is just posting a whole bunch of AI slop on GitHub to up the PR counter in his resume."

**@mikke89 (Maintainer):**
> "Forcing me to sift through tons of obviously AI-generated cruft is frankly insulting. Making an AI-generated PR without even testing it, even more so. Putting that huge issue document into the repo is comically dumb. Even if this works, I have no trust in the solution. Not without spending a lot more time studying this, likely more time than was used to generate it. Sorry, but this is not accepted here."

---

### 8. solvespace/solvespace [#1610](https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/pull/1610)

> "I've not tried this PR yet but it apparently was LLM generated (at least partially) - and at least the two new large .md files are completely unnecessary and should not be part of the commit."

---

### 9. ultimatepp/ultimatepp [#294](https://github.com/ultimatepp/ultimatepp/pull/294)

> "Don't waste your time, this user is just posting a whole bunch of AI slop on GitHub to up the PR counter in his resume."

---

### 10. NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra [#8373](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/8373)

> "FYI, this author is a heavy LLM user and does not vet the LLM output; they've been opening a lot of PRs that are then getting rejected for this."

### 11. the-tcpdump-group/libpcap [#1535](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/pull/1535)

> "@killerdevildog, second warning for posting a software-generated pull request."

---

### 12. schellingb/ZillaLib [#21](https://github.com/schellingb/ZillaLib/pull/21)

**@tobybear:**
> "Don't waste your time, this user is just posting a whole bunch of AI slop on GitHub to up the PR counter in his resume."

**@schellingb (Maintainer):**
> "One more thing, could you disclose if LLM code generation tools (like CoPilot or Gemini) were involved with this PR? If so, I have no interest in it. I see your GitHub account has contributed a large number of PRs to a wide variety of repositories in a rather short time, making me wonder if this is actually a human doing the work here."
>
> "I have to be honest with you, you are being a nuisance with what you are doing. You waste people's time with useless automatically generated nonsense. Have a look at what you are trying to contribute here. It's an inactive block of code. It does nothing. You haven't tested it and I assume you haven't even compiled the code you are trying to contribute under your name."
>
> "I'd never hire someone with a GitHub profile like yours. Seeing 'Created 100+ other repositories' there alone is a big big red flag. Don't you think your profile looks like either a scam or a bot? If you want to become a respected programmer that people will want to hire, write code. Write your own code. Show proof that you understand code. Submitting an ungodly amount of meaningless PRs every day won't impress anyone."

### 13. cfnptr/garden [#85](https://github.com/cfnptr/garden/pull/85)

> "This looks like AI slop, closing this."
